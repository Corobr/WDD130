        [Main Topic: Home Page - Welcome to My Portfolio

Welcome to My Site
Hey, welcome to my portfolio website! I’m a software engineering student at BYU-Idaho, and this site is an ever-evolvong online resume to show-case my skills, abilities, and experience. I want visitors to be able to see my projects and skills to market myself and open up the potential for career advancements. I have a wireframe, my website colors picked out, and a professional logo I made that is cutting edge yet simple. This site is all about showing who I am, my experience as a software engineer and why I would be a great addition to any team.

My Mechanic Background
Before I started studying software engineering, I was/currently am a mechanic for almost 10 years. I fix cars, figure out what is wrong with them, and make all the parts work together. It's a lot like software engineering because I love solving problems and making complicated systems run smoothly. Understanding the system is key to making it work efficiently. This website shows how I use that same thinking to write code and build programs.

Main Topic: About Page - Who I Am

What Makes Me Different?
Being a mechanic for so long has taught me how to deal with tough problems, with many possible causes, and make systems work, and I bring that same skill set to my coding. My projects show I can build stuff that works, not just throw code together. 

My Story
The "About" page will talk a lot about me, like where I’m from, my time as a mechanic, and why I decided to study software engineering. I’ll explain how I think about coding the same way I think about fixing cars, which helps me stand out. Visitors can see that I’m not just another coder but someone who really gets how and why systems fit together.

What People Want to Know
People coming to my website will probably wonder stuff like, what projects have I done? What coding languages do I know? Can I handle their company’s problems? I’ll answer those by showing my projects and talking about how I solve problems, so they can be confident in my ability to get the job done right the first time.

Main Topic: Projects Page - My Work

Checking Out My Projects
On my website, I will present some of my favorite projects and ones that I am proud of. Each one will have a name, what it does, what coding languages I used, like maybe Python or HTML, and a link to the code on GitHub. If I have a demo, I’ll link that too, to show proof of concept and further demonstrate my abilities.

Showing What I Can Do
The projects page will tell you what each project is about and what hoops I had to jump through to make it work. It serves as proof that I can code and develop complex systems that solve real problems, operate efficientlyl and are easy to use.

Main Topic: Contact Page

Contact Me
There will be a contact form on the site where people can send me a message if they want to contact me. It will ask for their name, email, and what they want to say. If they prefer another method of contact, my email address will be included as well as my professional links to my LinkedIn and other social media accounts.

My Resume
My resume will also be available to view. It will have my training and degree information, skills, and my mechanic experience, so you can see how it all connects to software engineering. It will be able to be viewed on any phone or computer.

Main Topic: How My Site Looks

Site Design
My website will be made to work on any device, like your phone or laptop, so it should be easy to use. I have a simple navigation tab with Home, About, Projects, and Contact, so you can find stuff fast. My colors make it look professional and advanced without being too space-age or Star Wars-like, and my logo has a tech vibe to tie it all together.

Why My Site Stands Out
The best part of my site is that it will be built from scratch by yours-truly. It has my story, my mechanic background, and my projects, all in one place. The design shows that I care about doing things right, and it is easy to see what I can do and how to reach me.]
