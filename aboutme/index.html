    <h2>Collin Breshears</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Collin Breshears! I am a software engineering major with a software management emphasis. I married my wife McKenna last July and we are currently living in Nampa, Idaho paying off some bills from a work accident I was involved in earlier last year.</p>
    <p>I have been a professional mechanic for the last 5 years to help pay for school and my mission. I served in the Farmington, New Mexico mission from 2019-2021 and spent almost 18 months on the Navajo Native American Reservation.</p>
    <p>I have always loved anything with an engine. I had a lot of dirt bikes in high school and have moved more into cars and trucks in the last few years.</p>
    <p>Web development for me is a way to broaden my skills and understanding of how things work and why they work together.</p>
    <p>I have always been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and have always loved the idea of being able to learn and progress eternally.</p>
